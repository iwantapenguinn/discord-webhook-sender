# discord-webhook-sender

sends discord webhook message with your webhook

pros:
  made by me Eclipse (discord) iwantapenguinn (github)
  cool matrix looking
  your webhook
  NOT double hooked (i think it means double webhooked)


cons:
  doesn't show on taskbar
  2 options (the webhook and the message)
  made in like 2 hours and edited 2 days
  6/10 fasle positive on virus total and 8/10 for threat zone both say suspicious

so yea consider useing this its simpler than https://discohook.org but not as many featchers
